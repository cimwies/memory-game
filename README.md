### The Game

Find all matching Cards by clicking on 2 Cards each move. 
If the 2 cards match, they'll stay visible, if they don't match, they'll be flipped and can be reselected again.
The Game is over when all matched cards are "discovered". A GameStatistics will be displayed.

Option "Beginner" is a visually easier version.
Option "Advanced" is a visually more difficult version.

### Technical Information

The Game consists of an HTML-, CSS-, and JS-file and diverse images.
The structure of the JS-file consists of many small "code fragments" that way a stepwise Game development was easier to handle for me.
